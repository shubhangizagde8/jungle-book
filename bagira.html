    Bagheera is presented as a wise figure. Level-headed and intelligent, <br>
    the panther is amongst the most down-to-earth residents of the jungle.  <br>
    When first introduced, he is seen as a selfless and caring individual, <br>
    rescuing the orphaned Mowgli, and going out of his way to ensure his safety <br>
    from that moment forward. <br>
