    Personality. Tabaqui is just as sneaky and cunning as Shere Khan, <br>
    but is not fierce like the tiger. He can also be pretty cowardly sometimes. <br>
     And yet, the jackal is also shown to be lazy seen in "Monster of The Cold Lair", <br>
      when he saw easier to take food from others instead of hunting for it. <br>
